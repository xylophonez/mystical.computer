--- An extension to the `hyper-token.lua` script, for execution with the
--- `lua@5.3a` device. This script adds the ability for an `admin' account to
--- charge a user's account. This is useful for allowing a node operator to
--- collect fees from users, if they are running in a trusted execution
--- environment.
--- 
--- This script must be added as after the `hyper-token.lua` script in the
--- `process-definition`s `script` field.

-- Process an `admin' charge request:
-- 1. Verify the sender's identity.
-- 2. Ensure that the quantity and account are present in the request.
-- 3. Debit the source account.
-- 4. Increment the balance of the recipient account.
